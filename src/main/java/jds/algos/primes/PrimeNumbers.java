        We can make this code run faster by noticing that we only need to check
        divisibility for values of i that are less or equal to the square root of n
        (call this m). If n divides a number that is greater than m then the result
        of that division will be some number less than m and thus n will also divide
        a number less or equal to m. Another optimization is to realize that there
        are no even primes greater than 2. Once weâ€™ve checked that n is not even we
        can safely increment the value of i by 2. We can now write the final method
        for checking whether a number is prime
